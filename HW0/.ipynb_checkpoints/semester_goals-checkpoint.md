# What do you wish to accomplish this semester in Data Mining?
* This semester, I want to learn the Data Mining concepts on top and that is my primary objective.
* With prior knowledge in Python, I want to take a deep dive into the important data mining concepts and complete the assignments on time.
* I understand that by the end of this semester, I will get to know the functionality of tools like GIT, Jupyter Notebook and some other Python Libraries.
* At the same time, learning things is not sufficient as we need to apply them in real-time too, so I want to go ahead and practice the skills I have learnt by doing different projects.
